Data Structure Suitability Explanation:
A linked list is suitable for this scenario because:

It allows for efficient insertion and deletion of records, which is essential for constantly updating personnel data in a dynamic environment like the army.
Linked lists can handle variable-length data efficiently, enabling the storage of diverse information such as name, rank, and unit for each soldier.
The flexibility of linked lists allows for easy traversal and manipulation of personnel records, facilitating operations such as searching, sorting, and updating information.
