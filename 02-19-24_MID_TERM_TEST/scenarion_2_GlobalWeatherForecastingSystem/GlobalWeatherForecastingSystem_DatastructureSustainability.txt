Scenario 2: Global Weather Forecasting System (Binary Tree)

Data Structure Suitability Explanation:
A binary tree is suitable for this scenario because:

It enables efficient organization and retrieval of weather data for various locations, supporting quick access to information based on location identifiers.
Binary trees offer fast searching capabilities, allowing meteorologists to locate weather data for specific locations rapidly.
The hierarchical structure of binary trees facilitates easy navigation and management of weather data, making it suitable for storing and processing large volumes of information in a global weather forecasting system.
