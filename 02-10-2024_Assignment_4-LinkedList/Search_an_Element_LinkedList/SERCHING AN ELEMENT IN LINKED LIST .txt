SERCHING AN ELEMENT IN LINKED LIST :

In the iterative approach to search for an element in a linked list, we search the list from the head node to the end while comparing each node value with the target value. If the target value is found,then  return true element is FOUND; otherwise, we continue traversing until we reach the end of the list or find the target value.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1.Start at the head node of the linked list.
2.Iterate through the list one node at a time.
3.At each node, check if the node's value matches the target value.
4.If a match is found, return true, indicating that the target value exists in the linked list.
5.If the end of the list is reached without finding the target value, return false.
6.Iterative vs. Recursive Approach for Searching an Element in a Linked List:

Iterative Approach:

Advantages:
1.Generally more memory-efficient as it doesn't involve additional function call overhead.
2.May be easier to understand and debug for some programmers.
Disadvantages:
1.May require more lines of code compared to a recursive approach.
2.May be less elegant and expressive compared to a recursive approach.

Recursive Approach:

Advantages:
1.Often more concise and expressive, leading to cleaner code.
2.Well-suited for problems that can be naturally expressed using recursion.

Disadvantages:

1.May consume more memory due to function call overhead and maintaining the call stack.
2.May be harder to understand for some programmers, especially those not familiar with recursion.
